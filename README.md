# Voxel engine
PoC project (archived). Ongoing work on a more generic and optimized voxel engine based on this project. 

A rasterization based deferred renderer ontop of OpenGL. Features SSR from transparent surfaces like water, SSAO, Cascaded-shadow-maps, etc. 
Supports day-night cycle with a dynamic skybox through atmospheric scattering.
GLFW, GLAD and ImGUI needed as dependencies. Currently only supporting MacOS as platform.
